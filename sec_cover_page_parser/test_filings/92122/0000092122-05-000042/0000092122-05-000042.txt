Item 2.02.        Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
                  ---------------------------------------------

         The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the
exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the
liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, such information, including the
exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in
any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be
expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

         On January 25, 2005, The Southern Company ("Southern Company") issued a
press release regarding its earnings for the quarter and year ended December 31,
2004. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current
Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the
financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 is being
furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.06 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

                       Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

         In the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.01, Southern
Company, in addition to presenting its earnings information in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), has also provided
non-GAAP earnings data for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003. The non-GAAP earnings data for the quarter and year ended December 31,
2004 reflects an adjustment to exclude a one-time gain related to the resolution
of an IRS audit for the years 2000 and 2001, which had the net effect of
increasing earnings by $24 million, or 3 cents per share. The non-GAAP earnings
data for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 reflects an adjustment to
exclude a one-time after-tax expense of $37 million, or 5 cents per share,
associated with an interim state regulatory order in December 2003 related to
the request of Mississippi Power Company to place additional capacity from Plant
Daniel into retail rates. In addition, the non-GAAP earnings data for the year
ended December 31, 2003 reflects an adjustment to exclude a one-time after-tax
gain of $83 million in May 2003, or 11 cents per share, related to the
termination of all long-term wholesale contracts with Dynegy, Inc. as adjusted
for revenues that would have been recognized for the remainder of the year.
Southern Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to
investors because the items excluded are not indicative of Southern Company's
continuing operating results and are excluded by Southern Company's management
for planning and forecasting purposes. The presentation of this additional
information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

                                    Exhibits

         The exhibits hereto contain business segment information for Alabama
Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power
Company, Savannah Electric and Power Company and Southern Power Company.
Accordingly, this report is also being furnished on behalf of each such
registrant.

                      Economic strength in Southeast drives
                  Southern Company earnings above expectations

ATLANTA - Southern Company today reported fourth quarter earnings of $204.5
million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $125.0 million, or 17 cents a share,
in the fourth quarter of 2003.

For the full year, Southern Company reported earnings of $1.53 billion, or $2.07
per share, compared with reported earnings of $1.47 billion, or 2.03 per share,
in 2003. The company's earnings target for 2004 was in a range of $1.94 and
$1.99 per share.

Continued economic vitality in the Southeast helped boost electricity sales and
was a key contributor to the fourth quarter and full-year results, which
exceeded analysts' expectations. Businesses and individuals continued to be
drawn to the Southeast, boosting the number of customers Southern Company serves
by 61,342, or 1.5 percent, in 2004.

"We are pleased with the excellent results we achieved in 2004," said Chairman,
President and CEO David M. Ratcliffe. "Our people delivered another outstanding
performance by continuing to focus on the fundamentals of giving customers
reliable power, low prices and great service."


<PAGE>

The 2004 earnings included one-time items in the fourth quarter related to the
resolution of an Internal Revenue Service audit for the years 2000 and 2001,
which had the net effect of increasing earnings by $24 million, or 3 cents per
share. Excluding the impact of these items, fourth quarter earnings were $180.4
million, or 24 cents a share. Earnings for the full year, excluding the one-time
items, were $1.51 billion, or $2.04 per share.

The 2003 earnings for the fourth quarter included a one-time after-tax expense
related to a regulatory order in Mississippi which reduced earnings for that
period by $37 million, or 5 cents a share. Excluding the impact of that one-time
item, earnings for the fourth quarter a year ago were $162.3 million, or 22
cents a share.

The full-year results for 2003 also included a one-time after-tax gain of $88
million related to the termination of all long-term wholesale power contracts
with Dynegy, Inc. After adjusting for revenues that would have been recognized
in 2003 had the contracts remained in place, the adjusted gain for 2003 was $83
million, or 11 cents per share. Excluding the impact of the Dynegy settlement
and the Mississippi regulatory order, full-year earnings for 2003 were $1.43
billion, or $1.97 per share.

The fourth quarter saw a continuation of the economic rebound that helped boost
electricity sales, most notably among large industrial customers, throughout
2004. Particularly strong growth in demand for electricity was seen during the
fourth quarter in the building materials, carpet, automobile equipment, steel
and paper industries.

The strong results for 2004 were achieved despite the extensive damage and
economic disruption in Florida and Alabama caused by Hurricane Ivan in
September. "Because of the outstanding response by Southern Company employees,
with assistance from many other companies and organizations, we were able to
restore service to our customers in record time and withstand the most severe
storm ever to hit our service territory," Ratcliffe said.

Revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.72 billion, compared with $2.52 billion
in the same period a year ago, an increase of 8.0 percent. Revenues for the full
year were $11.90 billion, compared with $11.19 billion in 2003, up 6.4 percent.

Kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service
area increased 3.6 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. Residential electricity
use increased 3.9 percent. Electricity use by commercial customers -- offices,
stores and other non-manufacturing firms - increased 3.4 percent. Industrial
energy use increased 3.6 percent.

Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast,
including wholesale sales, increased 0.1 percent in 2004, compared with the
previous year.

In conjunction with this earnings announcement, Southern Company has posted on
its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its fourth quarter
and full-year 2004 performance. These materials are available at 7:30 a.m. EST
Jan. 25 at www.southerncompany.com.

Forward Looking Statements Note:

Certain information contained in this release is forward-looking information
based on current expectations and plans that involve risks and uncertainties.
Forward-looking information includes, among other things, statements concerning
continued customer growth and Southern Company's strategies. Southern Company
cautions that there are certain factors that can cause actual results to differ
materially from the forward-looking information that has been provided. The
reader is cautioned not to put undue reliance on this forward-looking
information, which is not a guarantee of future performance and is subject to a
number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the control
of Southern Company; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such suggested
results will be realized.

The following factors, in addition to those discussed in Southern Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, and subsequent
securities filings, could cause results to differ materially from management
expectations as suggested by such forward-looking information: the impact of
recent and future federal and state regulatory change, including legislative and
regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric
utility industry, and also changes in environmental, tax and other laws and
regulations to which Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject, as well
as changes in application of existing laws and regulations; current and future
litigation, regulatory investigations, proceedings or inquiries, including the
pending EPA civil actions against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, current
IRS audits and Mirant-related matters; the effects, extent and timing of the
