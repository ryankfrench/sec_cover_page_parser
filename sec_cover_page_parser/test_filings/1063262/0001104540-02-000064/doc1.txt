             ITEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.


     We  have  engaged  a  new Independent Auditor, prospectively, to review and
comment  on  our next Annual Report, and to assist management in preparing other
current  reports. There has been no dispute of any kind or sort with any auditor
on  any  subject.

     The  new  principal  independent  accounting firm is Chisholm & Associates,
Inc.,  replacing  our  initial  principal  auditor,  HJ  &  Associates, LLC. The
decision  to  change  accountants  was  recommended and approved by our Board of
Directors.  The  firm of Chisholm & Associates, Inc. was engaged by the Board of
Directors  as  the  new  certifying  accountants  on  February  12,  2002.

     The  former  auditing  firm,  HJ  &  Associates,  LLC  neither resigned nor
declined  to  stand  for election. The former auditor's reports on the financial
statements  for  either  of  the  past two years contained no adverse opinion or
disclaimer  of  opinion,  nor  were  modified  as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles. During the two most recent fiscal years and later interim
periods  through  the termination of the client-auditor relationship, there were
no disagreements of the type described under Item 304(a)(1)(iv)(A) of Regulation
S-B.
