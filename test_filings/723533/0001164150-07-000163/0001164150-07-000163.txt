SECTION 8- OTHER EVENTS


Item 8.01- Other Events

     On November  19, 2007 the  Company  effected a reverse  split of its common
stock at a ratio of one (1) share for each two hundred  (200)  shares  currently
issued and outstanding.  The effective date of the reverse split is November 19,
2007, a date and time approved by NASD.

     Under the terms of the  Resolution  approved by the Board of Directors,  no
exchange of share  certificates is required.  The Company intends to continue to
use its  current  transfer  agent to effect  the  exchange  of any  certificates
following  the reverse  stock  split.  The split will occur  electronically  and
fractional  shares are rounded to the next highest  number.  The Company and the
transfer agent are prepared to act on this basis. As a result of the stock split
outlined above, NASD assigned a new trading symbol of EXTL.

     The purpose of the reverse split is to position the company more  favorably
for  acquisition  or  development  of  an  operating   company  for  its  future
development and growth.
