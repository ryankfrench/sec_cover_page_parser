			Exhibit 99.1

Apple Computer, Inc. Agrees to Acquire NeXT Software Inc.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--Dec. 20, 1996--Apple Computer, Inc. today 
announced its intention to purchase NeXT Software Inc., in a friendly 
acquisition for $400 million. Pending regulatory approvals, all NeXT 
products, services, and technology research will become part of Apple 
Computer, Inc. As part of the agreement, Steve Jobs, Chairman and CEO
of NeXT Software, will return to Apple--the company he co-founded in 
1976--reporting to Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio, Apple's Chairman and CEO.

The acquisition will bring together Apple's and NeXT's innovative and 
complementary technology portfolios and significantly strengthens 
Apple's position as a company advancing industry standards. Apple's 
leadership in ease-of-use and multimedia solutions will be married to 
NeXT's strengths in development software and operating environments 
for both the enterprise and Internet markets. NeXT's object oriented 
software development products will contribute to Apple's goal of creating
a differentiated and profitable software business, with a wide range of 
products for enterprise, business, education, and home markets.

Using NeXT technology to embrace open industry standards Apple 
Computer, Inc. believes the acquisition will allow the Company to further
develop industry alliances as the Internet/intranet market evolves. Apple
anticipates that NeXT's expertise in next-generation operating system 
design will allow elements of the NEXTSTEP operating system to become 
integral features of Mac OS--providing developers a compelling OS 
foundation on which to build next generation software solutions.

"The acquisition of NeXT is the start of a new chapter in Apple's history
and represents a milestone in our transformation as a corporation," said 
Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio, Chairman and CEO, Apple Computer Inc. "Today 
Apple welcomed back its most talented visionary" Steve Jobs, someone
who can inspire a new generation of customers and software developers 
and show that Apple remains the industry home for innovation and 
excitement. Today Apple returns, as an open player to the  mainstream 
and the heart of this industry, where our technology can once more set 
standards for innovation and excellence.

"Much of the industry has lived off the  Macintosh for over ten years now, 
slowly copying the Mac's revolutionary user interface," said Steven P. 
Jobs. "Now the time has come for new innovation, and where better  than 
Apple for this to spring from? Who else has consistently led this industry--
first with the Apple II, then the Macintosh and LaserWriter? With this 
merger, the advanced software from NeXT will be married with Apple's
				5
<PAGE>  
very high-volume hardware platforms and marketing channels to create 
another breakthrough, leapfrogging existing platforms,  and fueling Apple
and the industry copy cats for the next ten years and beyond. I still have 
very deep feelings for Apple, and it gives me great joy to play a role in
architecting  Apple's future."

Acquisition Confirms New Open Apple

The acquisition of NeXT is further evidence that Apple is fundamentally
changing the way it does business. Embracing outside technology and 
driving cross-platform industry standards,  Apple believes it can innovate
in the key areas that give its products and technology differentiation. 
NeXT's cross-platform development environments for enterprise and 
Internet/intranet markets, allow developers to write once and deploy 
across a range of Internet and client-server platforms.

In a new era of industry collaboration and joint initiatives--brought on by
the "megatrends" of pervasive Internet and ubiquitous multimedia--NeXT
technology complements Apple's strength in multimedia authoring and
playback, as well as Internet access, Internet authoring, and Internet server
solutions.

In the last year Apple has worked on a series  of collaboration initiatives
which leverage the  Company's core strengths in Internet,  multimedia,
and component software. Wide ranging agreements with Netscape
Communications, Sun Microsystems, and Silicon Graphics Computer
Systems--along with the acquisition of NeXT--confirm Apple is building
strategic relationships at the forefront of the information industry.

Developer Support

Software developers believe that the integration of NEXTSTEP technology 
in future versions of Mac OS will result in a robust, next-generation OS
that provides developers with a multimedia-rich and Internet-savvy 
platform.

"This partnership is the best possible fit. Both companies support strong,
open industry standards. Combined with their rich media focus and a 
command of the Internet, these strengths will play well into Adobe's core
markets", says  John Warnock, Chairman and CEO, Adobe Systems,  Inc. 
"NeXT's advanced operating system design, when combined with Apple's 
leadership in ease-of-use and multimedia, will provide Adobe and other 
developers with a robust, compelling platform on which to build great  
next-generation software solutions."

<PAGE>
Apple expects to be able to show substantial developer and industry
endorsements for Apple's new Mac OS system software strategy at 
MacWorld San Francisco in January 1997.

Apple Computer, Inc. believes the acquisition will provide a series of 
benefits for  customers, software developers, Apple Computer, NeXT, and 
the information technology industry. They include the following:

Enterprise Offering Enhanced

The combination of Apple technology, NeXT object oriented software 
development products,  and the "megatrend" of corporate-wide  intranets, 
gives Apple the opportunity to reinvigorate its offering to enterprise  
markets.

NeXT's OPENSTEP Enterprise and WebObjects development 
environments allow enterprise customers to develop software solutions 
quickly and deploy reusable applications on either traditional client-server
or Internet/intranet based networks. These powerful tools allow new  
applications to access legacy data and applications, a key concern for 
enterprise customers in the late 1990s. Customers currently using this 
technology range from  companies such as WebCrawler, Trilobyte and ID  
to large organizations including Fannie Mae,  Merrill Lynch, NASA, NTT, 
and AT&T Wireless.

In addition, NeXT's Sales and Professional Services team offers worldwide 
programs to  facilitate the knowledge transfer required to quickly take 
advantage of OPENSTEP Enterprise's unique capabilities. Apple 
envisages this team  will become a valued part of the Apple enterprise 
offering moving forward.

Internet/intranet Position Strengthened

A key strategic advantage of NeXT technology is its powerful 
Internet/intranet software development environment--WebObjects.

Today, Apple technology and customers are playing a pivotal role in the 
evolution of the  Internet--from easy to use powerful solutions in Internet
access, Internet authoring and Internet servers, to technologies such as  
QuickTime Media Layer (QTML) and HotSauce/MCF that set new 
standards in Internet multimedia and knowledge management. 
Combining these Apple strengths with WebObjects' unique capabilities to
access legacy data and applications will provide Apple with a strong 
offering for  companies reengineering their businesses to  take advantage
of the Internet. Customers currently using WebObjects technology include 
The Sharper Image, Ford, Nissan, Lufthansa, and Bell South.

<PAGE>
Again, Apple foresees NeXT's Sales and Professional Services team 
continuing to offer programs to companies who are implementing  
corporate-wide business reengineering based upon a new 
Internet/intranet infrastructure.

In addition, the momentum of Java, Sun Microsystems' platform-
independent programming  language, has led Apple to conclude that by  
implementing a Java architecture across its platforms and development 
tools portfolio, Apple systems will be at the forefront of Internet/Internet
design--an area of enormous potential growth through the millennium.

WebObjects' Java-enabled object oriented model complements Apple 
Computer's commitment to Java, which includes Mac OS Runtime for Java 
(currently in beta) and the integration of JavaBeans and OpenDoc 
component technology. Apple Computer, Inc. believes the acquisition of 
NeXT will give the Company the opportunity to become a preeminent 
development and deployment platform for Java technology.

Acquisition Kick-Starts Apple Software Business

The acquisition of NeXT's development products for enterprise and 
Internet markets will allow Apple to supplement its growing list of 
software products with a ready-made portfolio of powerful customer-
focused software solutions. Apple is committed to increasing the revenue 
it makes from its software products and the acquisition of NeXT is a 
significant development in building a differentiated, sustainable and 
profitable software business. Apple already has a number of software  
products--from QuickTime to HotSauce/MCF, which are driving industry 
standards in multimedia and Internet markets--to customer applications  
and tools such as Apple Internet Connection Kit (AICK), Apple Media 
Tool, Language Kits, and communications software.

Delivery of Next Generation Mac OS

Apple's exhaustive research in operating system design, led the company 
to conclude that NEXTSTEP's maturity, networking, customer and  
developer acceptance, multi-tasking, protected memory, and scalability 
from portable to server-level products make it the clear choice for 
integration into the next major revision of Mac OS. Apple believes that the 
integration of  NEXTSTEP technology in future versions of Mac OS will 
result in a robust, next generation OS that provides customers and 
developers with a multimedia-rich and Internet-savvy platform.

Apple Chairman and CEO Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio, Chief Technology Officer 
Ellen Hancock, and Steve Jobs will announce details of how Apple will
				8
<PAGE> 
incorporate NeXT technology into future releases of Mac OS at MacWorld 
San Francisco in January.

Acquisition Brings New Talent to Apple

The acquisition of NeXT will result in new management talent joining 
Apple Computer, Inc. Avie Tevanian, formerly NeXT's Vice President of 
Engineering, will join Apple to lead the Company's next generation OS 
development  efforts, reporting to Ellen Hancock, Apple's executive vice 
president of R&D, and Chief Technology Officer. Mitch Mandich, 
formerly  NeXT's vice president of Worldwide Sales and Services, will also 
join Apple, reporting to Marco Landi, Apple's executive vice president 
and Chief Operating Officer. Dominique Trempont, NeXT's Chief 
Financial Officer will also be joining Apple's executive team. As a  
complement to this initiative, Apple Computer, Inc. also announces that 
Rick LeFaivre has returned to the company as head of the newly formed 
Apple Technology Group. This group will house Apple's research 
laboratories, human interface technologies, and advanced systems 
architecture, offering support for hardware and software integration. Rick 
LeFaivre will report to Ellen Hancock in this new role. (See separate press 
release).
